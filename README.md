# CBTGTR template

I was incentivized to build this template by my friends group decision to write a book.
This lead to wholesome expirience of creating visually pleasing LaTeX template based on `book` class.
For visual hint on how this template looks when used, go to [this repository](https://github.com/jmi3/Public-texts/tree/main/Mathematical%20Perspective%20on%20Selected%20Games%20and%20Algorithmic%20Aspects%20of%20Solving%20Them) of mine, where I've uploaded file created by this template.
